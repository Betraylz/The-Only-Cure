# The Only Cure but better
A working version for SP and MP.
I'm not gonna bother "adding" stuff, for now.
If Mr Bounty returns, I'm probably not gonna continue this.

# BASIC TUTORIAL
If you've been bitten, there's only one thing you can do: cut your losses and cut off the infected limb. You need to have a Saw (or a garden saw) in your inventory, go to the health menu and click on "The Only Cure" button. You'll see a menu with the limbs you can amputate off. Select the bitten\lacerated\scratched\whatever part and press on "Cut". If you have bandages (sterilized or not), you'll make the process easier by automatically bandaging your limb after the deed is done. By cutting off a limb, you'll lose a level on Fitness and Strength. Now for the "easier" part, you'll have to wait until your wound is cicatrized. You can stitch the wound and bandage it, but it won't make the process any faster: you'll need a surgeon kit. These kits can be found in the wild or crafted by learning a specific recipe. After you've found a kit, you can get back to "The Only Cure" menu and click on "Operate" to make the cicatrization process faster. Higher tier kits make the process a lot faster than basic ones. Your First Aid skill will also count on how long you'll have to wait until your wound is completely healed. After the cicatrization is done, you'll be able to install some prosthetic limbs (only if you cut off your hand or forearm); as always, you'll have to find some specific recipes to craft them. With a prosthesis equipped, you'll be able to perform two handed tasks again, but a malus on time necessary will still apply.


# IMPORTANT
I basically rewrote most of the code, and some things with older character could break. I tried to make it as seamless as possible, but equipped prosthesis on character made with the older versions will disappear and you'll have to craft them again.
