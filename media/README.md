# The only cure - PZ mod
Bitten by a zombie? Do not panic ! At least if it's at the level of the arms.

I introduce you the only cure. The saw. 
If you apply the saw to the infected area a maximum of 12 hours after being bitten. The infection will go away and you can resume your life as normal!

Small flat on the other hand, during the application of the remedy you risk to scream very loudly. That's why I recommend having a box of painkillers with you at this time. (The fuller the box, the more efficient).
I also recommend having a bandage, with alcohol is better, at the time to reduce healing time.

Once the saw is applied, you end up with a wound that needs to heal. For that you can wait but it takes a lot of time. You can also operate with a surgeon's kit to speed up the process. There are three craftable kits, some better than others. You can also heal instantly by using an oven but that gonna leave a mark.

Now with your hand cut off, everything will take a long time and some actions (like holding a weapon in your hand) are no longer available. But then how to do? Once again, don't panic. I also offer prostheses to replace your severed limb! (Not available for fully cut arms). 
There are 3 prosthesis models, wooden hook, metal hook and metal hand. Equipped with a better prosthesis to reduce the time taken for actions. You need to be fully heal to equip it.

# Context
This is the beta of my first mod, it means that the main features are there, but I'm still adding features and fixing bugs. I also learn how to use git with this mod. I envy an act 2 to my mod for the legs once it is finished. If you want to redo the model, texture and icon, you are welcome! Contact me on the official game discord. @MrBounty. If you encounter a bug, try to detail as much as possible the conditions for the appearance of the bug. Like the exact action that created this bug and the previous few actions, or whatever you think is relevant.
